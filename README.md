🎓 Project Overview:

The Student Grade Calculator is a beginner-friendly Python program that accepts a student’s name and marks, validates the input, calculates the appropriate grade, and displays an encouraging message.
This project demonstrates decision-making, loops, functions, and basic error handling in Python.

🎯 Project Objectives:

Learn and apply if-elif-else decision statements
Use loops to handle invalid inputs
Create reusable functions
Implement input validation
Build confidence in writing real-world Python programs

🧠 Grading Logic:

Marks Range	Grade	Message
90 – 100	A	Excellent! Outstanding performance 🌟
80 – 89	B	Very Good! Keep it up 👍
70 – 79	C	Good job! You can do even better 💪
60 – 69	D	Fair effort. Keep practicing 🙂
0 – 59	F	Don’t give up! Learn and try again 💡
